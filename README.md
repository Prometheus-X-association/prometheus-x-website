Welcome on this collaborative platform dedicated to build the Data Space of Education & Skills (DASES) (External link) within GAIA-X (External link) framework.

Several educational organisations and companies have come together and formed a few working groups to bring to European level a sovereign vision of digital education, within an ethical and trust framework, which is developing and based on an adequate system of governance of education and skills data.

This platform presents the general progress of this work and the different use cases. It is managed by Prometheus-X, a non-profit association, and based on the decidim.org (External link) open source project.
